# TypeScript Type-Check Performance Benchmark Results

Benchmark results comparing TypeScript type-checking performance across runtime validation libraries.

## Methodology

- **What we measure**: Time for TypeScript to type-check inferred types from validation schemas (not runtime validation speed)
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9.3
- **Node version**: LTS
- **Config**: `noEmit: true`, `skipLibCheck: true`, `strict: true`, `incremental: false`
- Each test includes a `DeepReadonly` mapped type to force full type evaluation

## Libraries Benchmarked

- **ArkType** - Runtime schema validation with type inference
- **Effect** - Runtime schema validation with type inference
- **Valibot** - Runtime schema validation with type inference
- **Zod** - Runtime schema validation with type inference

## Caveats

- Results measured on specific hardware/OS; your mileage may vary
- Type-check time is only one factor in library selection
- Runtime validation performance not measured here
- All schemas designed to be equivalent across libraries
- Some libraries may have features not fully exercised in these benchmarks
